# Rapidclipse Demo: Using Drag&Drop within a Project

This demo project shows four different types of Drag&Drop handling. 

### See the following detailed informations:
1. Drag&Drop within a XdevTree. In this view you can Drag&Drop the "Products" within the XdevTree to add them to new "Categories". After drop the new Category will be stored in the database. You can see the update statement in the console.
2. Drag&Drop from a XdevTable to a XdevListSelect. This ist just an example to show how drag&drop works with two components.
3. Move a component per Drag&Drop directly on the screen. For sure a really rare functionality but nice to know how it works.
4. Upload a file by draging it from the desctop to the browser application

### Get the project running 
1. Clone the GIT reporsitory or use the import function of RapiClipse
2. File -> Import -> RapidClipse -> Demo Projects -> "rapidclipse-demo-dragdrop"
3. Maybe do some Maven updates to remove project errors
4. The project needs the H2Northwind database. The entities in the project should be syncronized with the database.
5. Start the project
6. Just try out the four different windows
